I am a 4th-year computer science Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Sanjit A. Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/). My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and formal methods, with an emphasis on compositionality as a core principle and AI safety and alignment as primary focus areas. I pursue two major directions: (i) developing compositional formal analysis techniques for the scalable verification of black-box systems, and (ii) designing learning frameworks that leverage the compositionality and well-defined semantics of formal models.

In 2020, I received my B.Sc. in computer engineering from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, where I was mentored by [Ebru Aydin Gol](https://cps.ceng.metu.edu.tr/people/ebru-aydin-gol/) as an undergraduate research assistant for three years and worked on timed automata and signal temporal logic. In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Kaiserslautern, Germany, advised by [Björn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/), where I applied timed automata to a schedulability problem in real-time systems. In 2019, I interned at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where I was advised by [George Candea](https://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/) and applied my formal methods background to latency analysis of networks.
